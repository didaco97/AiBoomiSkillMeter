SoluƟon Outline
1. Overview of the Proposed SoluƟon
The proposed soluƟon is an AI-powered personalized learning plaƞorm that transforms
unstructured free online educaƟonal content into a structured, goal-oriented, and assessment-driven
learning experience. The system leverages ArƟficial Intelligence to understand learner profiles,
generate customized learning roadmaps, enforce daily study rouƟnes, and evaluate learning
outcomes through content-based assessments.
2. Key Components of the SoluƟon
2.1 Learner Profiling
 Collects user details such as skill level, prior experience, learning goals, and available study
Ɵme.
 Uses AI to interpret learner input and personalize the learning journey.
2.2 AI-Based Content Discovery
 IdenƟfies high-quality free learning resources such as YouTube tutorials and reference
materials.
 Filters content based on relevance, difficulty level, and learning objecƟves.
 Reduces informaƟon overload by selecƟng only suitable content.
2.3 Personalized Roadmap GeneraƟon
 AutomaƟcally converts selected resources into a structured learning roadmap.
 Organizes topics into chapters and concepts with logical sequencing.
 Adjusts learning depth based on the learner’s proficiency level.
2.4 Daily Learning RouƟne & Task Scheduling
 Generates a day-wise study plan once a course is started.
 Assigns clear daily tasks to maintain learning consistency.
 Tracks task compleƟon and learning streaks.
2.5 AI-Generated Notes and Summaries
 Generates concise, concept-wise notes from learning content.
 Highlights key takeaways and important concepts.
 Enables quick revision and improved retenƟon.
2.6 AI-Based Assessment and EvaluaƟon
 Generates concept-specific assessments using learning content.
 AutomaƟcally evaluates learner responses.
 Provides instant feedback and performance scores.
 Ensures learning is outcome-oriented rather than passive.
2.7 Progress Tracking and AnalyƟcs
 Tracks learning progress, assessment scores, and compleƟon rates.
 Visualizes performance through dashboards and charts.
 IdenƟfies weak areas and recommends improvement.
2.8 NoƟficaƟon and Engagement System
 Sends daily reminders and alerts via email and SMS.
 NoƟfies users of missed tasks and achievements.
 Encourages consistent learning behavior.
